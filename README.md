# SQL Filtering Activity

This project demonstrates the use of SQL filtering techniques to identify potential security concerns in login data and employee records.

## Overview

As part of a simulated cybersecurity analyst role, I used SQL queries to investigate patterns related to system login attempts and employee machine updates. These queries helped identify failed logins after business hours, activity on specific dates, non-local access, and systems requiring updates.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Writing SQL queries using `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and `LIKE`
- Filtering data based on time, date, and text patterns
- Identifying security events using structured queries
- Interpreting query results to guide remediation steps

## Key Takeaways

This activity sharpened my ability to analyze and filter datasets using SQL, with a focus on real-world applications in cybersecurity and system monitoring. It highlights my approach to identifying suspicious patterns and supporting incident response with data-driven analysis.
